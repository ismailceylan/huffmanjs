# HuffmanJS
This is a JavaScript port of the [Huffman algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) in pure JavaScript.

It can compress given string and put huffman code into it. It can also decompress original data just using compressed binary.

It can also export huffman codes. So it can be stored in cloud and compressed part can circulate around with the light form.
